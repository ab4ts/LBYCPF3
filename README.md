# LBYCPF3 - Computer Vision Code Compilation

## Overview

Welcome to the **LBYCPF3 - Computer Vision Code Compilation** repository! This repository contains a collection of code implementations developed for our Computer Vision course, specifically for the LBYCPF3 and CPECOG1 subjects. The code was authored and curated by **Andrei Collado** to meet the requirements and objectives of the course. Each script and project included in this repository was designed to provide solutions to specific computer vision challenges and exercises.

### Course Information
- **Course Name:** Computer Vision (LBYCPF3)
- **Subject Code:** CPECOG1
- **Professor:** Jay Robert "Bok" Del Rosario

## Contents

The repository includes a series of codes, each corresponding to different lessons and topics in computer vision. The primary topics covered include, but are not limited to:

- **Image Processing Techniques**: Techniques such as image filtering, edge detection, thresholding, and segmentation.
- **Feature Extraction**: Algorithms for detecting and describing features in images, including methods like SIFT, SURF, and ORB.
- **Machine Learning in Vision**: Implementing machine learning models tailored for vision tasks, like classification, object detection, and clustering.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Basics of deep learning in computer vision, covering architecture, training, and practical applications.
- **Real-Time Video Analysis**: Tools and algorithms to process video streams and analyze frames in real time.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **src/**: Contains all the source code files.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks that include code with annotations and explanations to guide you through each concept.
- **data/**: Sample datasets used in the exercises (ensure to check the dataset license before using).
- **docs/**: Additional documentation, such as project descriptions, assignment briefs, and other related materials.
